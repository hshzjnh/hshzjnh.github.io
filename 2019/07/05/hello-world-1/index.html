        <p>&emsp; Computing and its applications have always fascinated me and for this reason I have found my computer-related courses extremely interesting. This also has maintained my long-term interest in computer-related careers.<br>&emsp;In fact, I have studied mathematics, physics and programming at my high school. In a chance, I heard the programming lesson of Pascal language, so I went to class every weekend, and gradually mastered computer-related knowledge. Since entering Nanjing University, I have been improving my self-learning, and developing many skills with the help of the key skills qualifications and General Studies.<br>&emsp;In terms of team building, I am full of insights and organizational skills. When I was very young, I was able to stand up and interact generously whenever there were activities that required participants and when my peers were hiding in the corner. In addition, when I was a child playing some team games, I always managed to organize the team as well as possible, so that everyone had enough participation. When I enter Nanjing University, I will still actively participate in some community activities and act as an organizer. For example, I am vice-minister of practice department in Tencent Club, responsible for the organization and planning of the activities of the whole team. During my undergraduate period, I also participated in the program of Nanyang Technology University with the theme of Entrepreneurial Leadership and Team Building, and further learned relevant skills.<br>&emsp;I firmly believe that life is like swimming. This is because as a 0-based classmate, I enrolled in an undergraduate swimming course. Compared with my classmates who already had a swimming foundation in junior high school, I did not give up, but seized the Wednesday noon diligent practice, and finally achieved 97 points of excellent results. So, life is like swimming, I firmly believe that in any field, as long as we work hard enough, as long as we spend enough time and energy, we can achieve success.<br>&emsp;My sincerest desire is to become a computer scientist. Specifically, I am interested in exploring how problems can be modeled and solved using artificial intelligence. I also want to learn about human cognition and machine intelligence. I have been studying the online debate over whether machines will ever become “intelligent” given the current course of research and reading about such issues as whether a machine can acquire “common sense” (as discussed in Hubert Dreyfus’s book “What Computers Still Can’t Do”). I have been exploring many different areas within the domain of artificial intelligence (such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, and natural language processing). The bottom line is that I want to be a part of this exciting field.<br>&emsp;My other hobbies include current affairs politics, model assembly and science fiction movies. In the first two decades of my life, I insisted on watching the 7:30 news broadcast every night, as well as the international news of CCTV 13. In addition, every winter and summer vacation, I will buy some model toys for assembly. Even, I try to learn three-dimensional modeling software, such as maya, to build my own model and do some 3D printing. In science fiction movies, I watched almost all science fiction movies in American history and left a lot of reviews on Douban. In addition to studying academics, I want to continue these hobbies in the future.</p>
